:dad:Nice. You're pretty good at this. 
:dad:So let's turn up the pace a bit.
:dad:195BPM good with you?
:bf:Bop.
:dad:Lit. But first, a conveniently placed, 4th-wall-breakin' advertisement.
:bf:Bep??
:dad:CryoGX made this mod. Most all of its art and music was done by him.
:dad:I'm from AdventNEON, an action platformer that he's also making by himself.
:dad:I don't fight humans like you, but over there I trash haywire bots at lightspeed.
:dad:And can literally FREEZE TIME to punch them harder.
:dad:If you like what you see and hear, here, there's literally more of me in free demos.
:dad:On Steam, Newgrounds, Itch.io, and CrazyGames.
:dad:That stuff ain't easy, so if you're liking this mod, definitely check out AdventNEON too!
:bf:Beep.
:dad:Ai'ight, let's gettit.
